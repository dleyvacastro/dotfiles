# General Info
![alt text](/img/Endeavour_logo.png) \
I'm actually using [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) with the Xfce desktop enviroment base.
This is an user friendly Arch Based distro. Xcfe provides all the basic utilities like network managment, file manager, etc. But 
it's only used as base, thus, my usual enviroment is composed by a stad alone Tiling Window Manager and
some dependences like Nitrogen, Picom and some theming.

New Target Distro: [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
The objective is being capable of set working full-featured and minimalist work enviroment from base arch.
